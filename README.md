Model Training & Evaluation

In this project, I trained a regression model to predict house prices based on the processed and engineered dataset. The workflow includes splitting the data into training and testing sets, selecting suitable regression algorithms (like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost), hyperparameter tuning, and validating the model’s performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² score. Model evaluation results and insights are included to ensure the model’s predictions are reliable and generalize well to unseen data.
